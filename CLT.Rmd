Here's some R code to simulate the Central Limit Theorem

```{r}
exponential <- rexp(1000)
CLT <- NULL
for (i in 1 : 1000) CLT <- c(CLT, mean(rexp(40)))
mean(exponential)
mean(CLT)
```

Here are the histograms of the two distributions:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
hist(exponential, col = "green")
hist(CLT, col="green")
```
